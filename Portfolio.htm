		<p>I am a CompTIA-certified Information Technology professional with a passion for creativity and the arts.  I have an extensive professional background in non-profit technology, public health, data management, research, engineering for developing communities, and human rights advocacy.<br />
		<br />
		Through my work as an administrator, engineer, health care volunteer and human rights advocate, I have helped to offer sustainable, community-driven technical solutions to non-profit organizations and the vulnerable populations they serve in the Americas and South Asia.  Over the last decade and a half, I have had the great pleasure of working with organizations such as Engineers Without Borders USA and Boulder County AIDS Project.  I believe in hard work and enjoying success as a team.<br />
		<br />
		I am a native English speaker with beginning proficiency in Spanish and American Sign Language (ASL).  I am also learning French and how to code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails.<br />
		<br />
		Volunteering in my community is very important to me - everything from working as a cook in soup kitchens to talking with other women who are interested in technology careers.  As I live, learn and pursue my passions, I hope to help others do the same.  I also love to explore new recipes in the kitchen and grow my own food.  I play the cello and bass, collect comic books, and enjoy playing video and board games.  I prefer to read books made of paper and love characters with a great backstory.  My favorite things to do are: travel, draw, take photos of everything using my vintage Polaroid camera, and hold my face up towards the sun.<br />
